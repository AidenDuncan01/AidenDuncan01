# Hi there, I am Aiden

I am a machine learning engineer aspiring to program full time. With 4+ years experience, i've been honing my skills in various aspects of programming, from machine learning to back end functionality. In addition to my machine-learning background, I'm excited to pursue university in software development, primarily when artificial intelligence is involved. 

I primarily opperate in Python and, by extension, Jupyter Notebook. Occasionally I dabble in When workign with artificial intelligence, I often rely on Tensorflow/Keras for training and deploying models. I've previously interned at Lockheed Martin, wherein I am not at liberty to discuss the details of my work completed there.

***I Build:***
- Computer Vision Models
- Image Segmentation Models
- Image Classification Models
- Real-Time Detection Models
- and more to come
